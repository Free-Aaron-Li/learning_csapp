## Briefly Introduces

This repository contains code implementations for textbook code reproduction, knowledge applications and exercises, and homework.

All code is implemented in C++17 and uses gcc-cmake-ninja as the project toolchain. And this project completes all code writing on [CLion](https://www.jetbrains.com/clion
).

## Project Folder Properties

- `code`. Store main, header file implementation, etc.
- `include`. Store header files (homework, exercises, code reproduction, etc).
- `assets`. Store project resources, pictures, class diagrams, flow charts, etc.
